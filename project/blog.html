          If you’re looking for an adorable little pooch who will steal your
          heart away and never give it back, then you just found him. A
          toy-sized pooch with a big ol’ personality, the unique Miki Dog is a
          bonafide heart stealer. These adorable little dogs are friendly,
          sweet, and have the cutest appearance. Many pet owners have already
          fallen deeply in love with this breed and many more will follow. It’s
          almost impossible not to if you have even the slightest appreciation
          for fuzziness or cuteness. On average, these pups weigh under 10
          pounds, so they are popular with small breed dog admirers. They are
          ideal for life in an apartment since their miniature stature will make
          any space seem spacious.

          Having only been developed in the 1980s, the Miki (or Mi-Ki) Dog
          breed, is still considered to be fairly new and it is actually still
          quite rare as well. This breed looks like a cross between a Japanese
          Chin, a Maltese, and a Papillon because it has a very small stature
          with long, flowing hair, and feathered ears. This breed combines
          aspects from many different toy breeds, but it has a look and a
          personality that is all its own. If you are looking for a small-breed
          dog that exhibits a high level of intelligence, while still being calm
          and affectionate, the Miki Dog may be a good option for you. These a
          bright and affectionate little guys despite looking like they might be
          yappy and dumb. If you generally don’t like toy dogs because of their
          behavioral issues, the Miki Dog is the well behaved beauty that will
          change your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, the Miki Dog is not a perfect choice for every dog
          owner. If not socialized early enough, they might be prone to
          behavioral issues. Separation anxiety can also be a problem, since
          these dogs don’t do well with being left alone for hours on end. So,
          while the Miki Dog can bust many of the stereotypes of toy dogs, it’s
          only if you are will to put in the work as a responsible dog owner
          and/or trainer. To learn more about the traits of this rare and recent
          breed, as well as find out all about their quirks and requirements,
          read on! All of the Miki Dog secrets are about to be revealed.
